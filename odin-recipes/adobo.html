    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The Filipino adobo is a cooking process or technique where meat, seafood, or indigenous vegetables are braised in a mixture of vinegar with aromatics such as garlic, onions, peppercorns, and bay leaves.</p>
    <p>As many and as diverse are the islands and dialects in the Philippines are the many ways adobo is prepared. With atsuete, in coconut milk or sweetened with pineapples are just a few versions of this classic Filipino national dish.</p>
