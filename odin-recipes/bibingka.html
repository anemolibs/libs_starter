                <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>This recipe for bibingka, the celebratory rice cake traditionally eaten around Christmastime in the Philippines, comes from the New York restaurateur Nicole Ponseca.</p>
                    <p>It's a savory side dish with an edge of sweetness, and she always includes it on her Thanksgiving table. Cooked in cast-iron for a deeply golden crust, and hiding slices of salty preserved eggs, the bibingka is topped with grated cheese that gets brown and crisp. Though Ms. Ponseca prefers bibingka without additional coconut on top, traditionalists may want to add a sprinkle.</p>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                    <ul><li>2 cups/320 grams rice flour</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup/55 grams glutinous rice flour</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>3/4 cup/150 grams granulated sugar</li>
                        <li>1/3 cup/76 grams unsalted butter, melted, plus more melted butter for topping, and butter for greasing pan</li>
                        <li>1 1/2 cups/355 milliliters coconut milk</li>
                        <li>3 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
                        <li>1 banana leaf (optional)</li>
                        <li>1 salted duck egg, sliced (optional)</li>
                        <li>1 cup/80 grams grated queso de bola or Cheddar cheese</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup/52 grams grated coconut, for topping (optional)</li>
                    </ul>
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol><li>Heat oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, whisk together rice flours, baking powder, salt and sugar.</li>
                        <li>Make a well in the center and pour in melted butter, coconut milk and eggs. Whisk mixture until smooth.</li>
                        <li>Wash and dry banana leaf, if using, and line a 9-inch cast-iron skillet with it. (One leaf should be enough, but if more are needed, make sure to overlap leaves so there are no gaps.)</li>
                        <li>Butter the leaf, and trim edges leaving a 1- to 2-inch overhang. Alternatively, generously grease skillet with butter.</li>
                        <li>Pour mixture into skillet and bake 15 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Remove from oven and top with salted egg and cheese.</li>
                        <li>Return skillet to oven until bibingka is golden and browned, and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes more.</li>
                        <li>Brush with more melted butter and sprinkle with coconut, if desired.</li>
                    </ol>
